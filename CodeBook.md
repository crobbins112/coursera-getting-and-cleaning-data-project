Code Book

This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in tidySet2.txt.

Introduction

The script run_analysis.Rperforms the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.

Information on the course project as well as details on the data set can be found in the read me file. Below are lists of the Indentifiers used in the analysis, as well as the measurements performed.

Identifiers

subject - The ID of the test subject
activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

Activity Labels

WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test

The set of variables that were estimated (and kept for this assignment) from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
